==============================================================================
1. Intro                                                        *startify-intro*

Startify is a zero-conf plugin which shows recently used files, bookmarks and
sessions that were saved to a certain directory.


==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                        *startify-usage*

Startify basically provides two things:

1) If you start Vim without giving any filenames to it (or pipe stuff to it so
   it reads from STDIN), startify will show a small but pretty start screen
   which shows recently used files (using viminfo) and sessions by default.

   Additionally, you can define bookmarks, thus entries for files that always
   should be available in the start screen.

   You can either navigate to a certain menu entry and hit enter or you just
   key in whatever is written between the square brackets on that line. You
   can even double-click anywhere on the line now.

   Per default the startify buffer gets closed automatically, if an entry was
   selected.

   You can reopen the screen via :Startify.

   Moreover, 'e' creates an empty buffer, 'i' creates an empty buffers and
   jumps into insert mode, 'q' quits.

2) It eases handling of loading and saving sessions by only working with a
   certain directory. These commands are used for convenience:

      :SLoad    load a session
      :SSave    save a session
      :SDelete  delete a session

The default settings are pretty sane, so it should work without any
configuration.


==============================================================================
3. Options                                                    *startify-options*

Put these variables into your vimrc. The shown assignments are also the
default values.

============-

    let g:startify_empty_buffer_key = ''

This creates an additional, hidden mapping for the empty buffer.

Example: let g:startify_empty_buffer_key = 'o'


============-

    let g:startify_session_dir = '~/.vim/session'

The directory to save/load sessions to/from.

The default for Windows systems is '$HOME\vimfiles\session'.


============-

    let g:startify_show_sessions = 1

List saved sessions in g:startify_session_dir.


============-

    let g:startify_show_files = 1

List recently used files using viminfo.


============-

    let g:startify_show_files_number = 10

The amount of files to list.


============-

    let g:startify_bookmarks = []

A list of files to bookmark. Those files will always be shown at the bottom of
the start screen.

Example: let g:startify_bookmarks = [ '~/.vimrc' ]

============-

    let g:startify_skiplist = []

A list of Vim regular expressions to filter recently used files.

Example: let g:startify_skiplist = [
           \ 'COMMIT_EDITMSG',
           \ $VIMRUNTIME .'/doc',
           \ 'bundle/.*/doc'
           \ ]


============-

    let g:startify_skiplist_server = []

Do not create the startify buffer, if this is a Vim server instance with a
name contained in this list.

Example: let g:startify_skiplist_server = [ 'GVIM' ]


============-

    let g:startify_custom_indices = []

Use any list of strings as indices instead of increasing numbers. If there are
more startify entries than actual items in the custom list, the remaining
entries will be filled using the default numbering scheme starting from 0.

Thus you can create your own indexing scheme that fits your keyboard layout.
You don't want to leave the home row, do you?!

Example: let g:startify_custom_indices = ['a','s','d','f']

This would result in:

    [a]  /last/recently/used/file1
    [s]  /last/recently/used/file2
    [d]  /last/recently/used/file3
    [f]  /last/recently/used/file4
    [0]  /last/recently/used/file5
    [1]  /last/recently/used/file6
    etc.

NOTE: There is no sanitizing going on, so you should know what you're doing!

Best practices:

- do not use 'e', 'i' or 'q' (they will be overwritten anyway)
- do not use duplicates (previous mappings will be overwritten)
- do not uses empty strings (creates unreachable entries)
- (you might want to keep 'j' and 'k' for navigation)


============-

    let g:startify_enable_special = 1

Don't show <empty buffer> and <quit>.


==============================================================================
4. Commands                                                  *startify-commands*

    :SLoad    load a session
    :SSave    save a session
    :SDelete  delete a session

These take either 0 or 1 argument. If you don't specify the session name as an
argument, they will just ask for it.

Providing only a part of the session name works too, if you complete the
argument with either <c-d> or <tab> afterwards.


    :Startify

Open the startify buffer.


==============================================================================
5. Colors                                                      *startify-colors*

You can overwrite the highlight groups used by startify. The plugin defines
these groups:

    StartifyBracket         [,]
    StartifyFile            the actual file
    StartifyNumber          the numbers between []
    StartifyPath            the path to a file
    StartifySlash           slashes in paths
    StartifySpecial         <empty buffer>,<quit>

Example: (my terminal emulator supports 256 colors)

    hi StartifyBracket ctermfg=240
    hi StartifyNumber  ctermfg=215
    hi StartifyPath    ctermfg=245
    hi StartifySlash   ctermfg=240


==============================================================================
6. FAQ (Or: Typical rants)                                        *startify-faq*

"I don't want the start screen to use cursorline!"
--------------------------------------------------

Startify sets its own filetype "startify". Thus one could set buffer-local
options like this:

    autocmd FileType startify setlocal nocursorline


"Last recently used files don't seem to get updated at :Startify!"
-----------------------------------------------------------

It's because Vim loads the list from viminfo only once, at startup.


"I use iTerm2 and have broken colors when using sessions!"
----------------------------------------------------------

Nothing this plugin could do about. Try playing around with 'sessionoptions'.
Some people swear it works for them with these settings:

    set sessionoptions=blank,curdir,folds,help,tabpages,winpos
